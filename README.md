### Introduction and Purpose
Welcome to our humble Calculator React App.

A little background on ourselves...

[@cfaloon](https://github.com/cfaloon) has been a professional software developer since 2011. In the summer of 2017 he took up an opportunity to teach web application development to eager, burgeoning developers. [@Brandonniles](https://github.com/Brandonniles) was one of those go-getters from the Fall 2017 cohort of aspiring developers. After the session had ended, both were still anxious for more. As [@Brandonniles](https://github.com/Brandonniles) was enrolled in the Javascript App Development course, and [@cfaloon](https://github.com/cfaloon) had not yet worked with React - but had wanted to for a few months - the two concocted a project to tackle with React as the solution. Thus the Calculator project was born.
